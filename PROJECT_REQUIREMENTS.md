# Public Infrastructure Issue Reporting System - Project Requirements

## Description
The Public Infrastructure Issue Reporting System is a digital platform that enables citizens to report real-world public issues such as broken streetlights, potholes, water leakage, garbage overflow, damaged footpaths, etc. Government staff and admins can manage, verify, assign, and resolve reported issues efficiently.

Municipal services often suffer from delayed response and lack of tracking. Citizens have no centralized platform to report problems.

**This system:**
*   Improves transparency
*   Reduces response time
*   Helps collect and analyze infrastructure data
*   Makes city service delivery more efficient

## How the System Works
1.  **Citizens** submit a report with issue details, photos, and location.
2.  **Admin** reviews & assigns the issue to staff.
3.  **Staff** verifies the issue and updates progress.
4.  **System** tracks status from `Pending` → `In-Progress` → `Resolved` → `Closed`.
5.  **Citizens** get updates and can track their issue anytime.
6.  **Premium citizens** get priority support.

## Expectations
Deliver a polished, bug-free, and impressive application that stands out in terms of both functionality and design.
